        <p class="bio">
          Dylan Truenow is a singer, songwriter, and producer from Central Florida whose 
          recent work has garnered attention and praise from Grammy Award Winning vocalist 
          KayCyy and former Brockhampton member Merlyn Wood. Truenow creates tracks highlighting 
          his personal struggles as well as his ambitions. He draws influence from a wide range 
          of musicians ranging from Elton John to Travis Scott. His signature production style 
          skillfully fuses Pop/RnB inspired vocal harmonies, warped piano loops, Mike Dean synths, 
          and trap and house drums. Dylan’s musical journey began at the age of six when he started 
          taking piano lessons which, he says, laid the foundation for his current productions. 
          After a 5 year musical hiatus his love for music was rekindled through hip hop production.
          He immediately got to work crafting his sound through the only resources he had available: 
          GarageBand on his iPhone and his musically inclined peers. He honed his vocal chops in the 
          school choir where he was a natural. He went to all state in his first year. Now Dylan has 
          production credits on 8 out of 9 tracks on ZTrak’s debut LP “Change of Plans” which is set 
          to release in late July. He is also working on an album of his own to release in the near 
          future. Dylan is a founding member of the Eleven Ten Music Collective and hopes that his 
          sound can bring a new level of musicality to the rap genre.
