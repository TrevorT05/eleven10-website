        <p class="bio">
          ZTrak is a rapper, singer, songwriter, and visual artist from Orlando, Florida. Utilizing clever
          wordplay he is able to touch on personal issues, emotions, and aspirations. Many of his tracks are 
          comprised of diverse melody and rhythm mainly influenced by an array of artists ranging from Baby 
          Keem to Ski Mask The Slump God. ZTrak’s first introduction to music was through visual art. From a 
          young age, he was always fascinated by sketches and paintings of various landscapes and people. As 
          time went on, he became curious about the visual artistic styles that were represented on album and 
          single covers shared. After discovering artists through this method, a new passion for the sonic 
          counterpart of these projects was developed. A favorite pastime of his became freestyling different 
          lyrics and melodies at home in an attempt to hone his musical ability. ZTrak’s sound features a fusion 
          between singing and rap that is reinforced by perceptive lyricism as well as impassioned delivery. 
          Now, in collaboration with Colby Helms and Dylan Truenow, ZTrak is set to release his debut LP “Change 
          Of Plans” in late July. This LP will be comprised of 9 tracks, including features from Dylan Truenow 
          and Colby Helms, that tackle the difficulty of enduring the stages of grief. ZTrak aspires to shed 
          light on the intangible struggles of life whilst also bringing a unique sound to the rap scene.
