        <p class="bio">
          Colby Helms is a songwriter, beatmaker, multi-instrumentalist, and audio engineer from the Orlando, 
          FL area whose recent works have garnered attention and praise from Grammy Award Winning vocalist 
          KayCyy and former Brockhampton member Merlyn Wood. Colby is the founder of the Eleven Ten Music 
          collective and has been fusing Alt-Rnb, Alt-Rock, and Alt-Rap with Orlando Drill. After playing 
          gigs around his hometown as the guitarist/singer/frontman in his family band, he recorded one of 
          his first songs, I Don’t Wanna Talk to You at age 13 with a sticky and angsty hook that quickly 
          gained thousands of views and strongly resonated with his peers. Colby is currently finishing up 
          with his production and mix work on ZTrak’s debut album Change of Plans where he has a verse featured 
          on the title track. Colby is currently writing his own collection of songs with his strongest influences 
          being KAYTRANA, Mac Miller, and Smino, which he hopes can bring a different sound to the hip hop scene in his home city.
