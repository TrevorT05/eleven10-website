          Eleven 10 is a music collective that is carving out their own unique path in the thriving 
          Central Florida music scene through their genre-merging music and visuals. The collective 
          is named after an alleged angel number that represents success and being on the correct path 
          in life, this is reflected in the passion that each member puts into their craft and the art 
          that is yet to be released.
